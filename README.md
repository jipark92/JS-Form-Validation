# JS-Form-Validation

Project Objective:

    -Build a browser form which collects Email, Country, Zip Code, Password and Password Confirmation fields. 

    -It should use live inline validation to inform the user whether a field is properly filled in or not. 
    
    -That means highlighting a field red and providing a helpful error message until it has been filled in properly.

    -The form doesn’t need to actually submit, but you should give an error message if the button is pushed with any active errors or unfilled required fields. 
    
    -For the sake of this lesson, make sure all of the validation occurs in the JavaScript file. If all is well and the form is “submitted”, give the user a high five.
